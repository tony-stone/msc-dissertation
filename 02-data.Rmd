# Data {#data}

There is a lack of publicly available, representative datasets for the 
evaluation of data linkage processes[@ferrante2012]. "Gold-standard" linked 
datasets are few and, due to confidentiality laws, sharing seldom possible.

This study used a subset of data collected from Wikimedia's Wikidata Query Service for 
Wikidata entries classed as human. The final dataset consisted of 113,232
distinct individuals listed as British (UK) citizens. The dataset with fields for:
* Unique person ID (assigned by Wikidata) [0.0%]
* first name [0.0%]
* surname [0.7%]
* date of birth [5.3%]
* place of birth [0.0%] (these were randomly assigned if not present in the extracted Wikidata)
* postcode (these are valid UK postcodes assigned based on place of birth) [0.0%]
* gender [1.0%]
* occupation [29.6%]
