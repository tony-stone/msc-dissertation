## Record linkage

Record linkage or entity resolution is the process of identifying records belonging to the same individual (or entity) from a set or sets of multiple records. In the absence of "good" identifiers (e.g. passport number), other attributes that relate to the entities (e.g name, date of birth) present in the compared records may be used to estimate an overall "match weight" for each pair of compared records. The match weight is based on conditional probabilities of pairs of records truly belonging to the same entity (match) or truly not belonging to the same entity (non-match) given how they agree on the compared attributes. This is known as the Fellegi-Sunter model of probabilistic record linkage.

The pairwise comparison of all records grows in proportion to the square of the number of records, rapidly leading to computational challenges. Additionally, usual methods (Expectation-Maximisation) to estimate the conditional probabilities may not work if the number of true match pairs is too few relative to the total number of pairwise comparisons. A solution to these problems is to use blocking rules such that for each blocking rule only pairs which agree on one or more attributes are compared. This reduces the comparison space.

Pairs of records may be considered to belong to the same entity if their match weight is above a certain threshold. Alternatively, two thresholds may be chosen:

-   a lower threshold, below which each pair of records is deemed not to belong to the same entity; and
-   an upper threshold, above which each pair of records is deemed to belong to the same entity.

Records with a match weight between the lower and upper threshold (or a sample thereof) undergo manual review. Choice of threshold(s) may be chosen based on aims of the record linkage process, with consideration of the relative importance of sensitivity and specificity.

Frequently it is the case that there are more than two records belonging to the same entity in an entity resolution process. When this is the case a further step is required to identify the set of records belonging to each entity, clustering. Clustering is the process of labeling all records deemed to belong to the same entity with a unique identifier for that entity. The outputs of the Fellegi-Sunter record linkage process is compared pairs of records. It may be the case that a record linkage process involving three records (A,B,C) results in pairs AB and BC being assigned a match weight greater than an identified match weight threshold but pair AC being assigned a match weight lower than this threshold. In such cases transitive closure is often applied. Under transitive closure records A and C are deemed to belong to the same entity also.

## Graph representation of record linkage outputs

The outputs of a pairwise record linkage process are naturally represented by undirected graphs consisting of a vertex for each record and an edge for each pairwise comparison of records.

Considering the case with a single match weight threshold, one representation may be a graph which only includes edges representing pairwise comparisons that had a match weight greater than the threshold.

A second representation may include all edges (or only those above some other threshold) with their match weight (suitably transformed) to be represented by the weight of the edge.

A third representation may include not just the overall match weight of pairwise record comparisons (edges) but also, for each compared attribute, the contributing components to the overall match weight as additional edge attributes.

## Graph measures

Say something about how graph measures may be used to identify false positive

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can call your first chapter (and all the others) whatever you wish, but it is usual to start with an introduction to your project and, perhaps, a discussion of some background literature.

When you are discussing other people's work, you might find the following snippets of \LaTeXÂ helpful. You might make references like these if you want to discuss the work of @lambert and @dellas within a sentence. Then, later, you might also want to make some parenthetic references to support an argument that you are making, like this [@lambert]. (I'm not aware of equivalents to commands such as `\citeyear` and `\citeauthor`, but you should be able to manage without these.)

In the next chapter, we provide some more snippets that you might find useful. We do not give advice about the structure of the dissertation here, since that is covered in the separate document on Dissertation Expectations (on Blackboard), but do remember the very strict page limit of 70 pages in the main matter of your dissertation (all Chapters, but not references or appendices). Those working on theoretical topics, with little need for figures and tables in their dissertation, should aim for considerably fewer than 70 pages (typically 30--50). If you do submit something longer, examiners will read only the first 70 pages (or 50 pages of more theoretical material). Note too that, regardless of length, any material in appendices will only be inspected cursorily by examiners. You should thus use appendices judiciously.
