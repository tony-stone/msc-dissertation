The thrust of the work herein described is to evaluate the use of graph measures 
for identifying clusters of records containing false links within the 
outputs of a commonly used record linkage / de-duplication process.

## Linkage threshold

Whilst in a normal record linkage process the true match status is not known 
(or known only for a small sample of records), the true match status 
(or "ground truth") is known for all records in
the de-duplication datasets. Thus, for each de-duplication dataset, a single 
linkage threshold was chosen such that compared pairs of records with a match 
score greater than the threshold were considered links, otherwise 
pairs of records were not considered to be links.

The linkage threshold chosen for each de-duplication datasets was that which 
maximised the F-measure for that dataset. The F-measure is the harmonic mean of 
the recall (true matches divided by the sum of the true matches and false 
non-matches) and precision (true matches divided by the sum of the true matches 
and false matches).

Linked records were subsequently clustered into entities based on the 
transitive closure method discussed previously, see Chapter \@ref(intro).

## Graphs

Since graph measures, in this context, are wholly uninteresting for graphs of 
less than 3 vertices, all such graphs (of only 1 or 2 vertices) were excluded. 

```{r cluster-eg, fig.cap = "An example of a graph. Vertices of the same colour represent records which relate to the same person, edge width is proportional to the match score of the connected records, and true/false links are represented by black/red coloured edges, respectively. Two clusters (red vertices and green vertices) are internally connected with high match scores and connected to one another with (false) match scores only just above the linkage threshold."}
