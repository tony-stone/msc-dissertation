# Research Ethics Approval

The last appendix of your dissertation must contain evidence that you complied with the University of Sheffield research ethics approval process. Like all other appendices, it should be cross-referenced from the main text of the dissertation so that readers are alerted to its presence. The appendix should start with a paragraph of text, in your own words, that summarises the approval process as it applied to your dissertation. Here is an example to get you started.

The research ethics approval process for the work described in this dissertation was completed in March 2019, before any work using data commenced. Due to the use of data arising from {summarise the data collection process here}, formal research ethics approval was deemed to be necessary and, when submitted, the application was allocated reference number: 000094. Formal approval is evidenced here by inclusion of the final approval letter in Figure \@ref(fig:ethicsapprov).
