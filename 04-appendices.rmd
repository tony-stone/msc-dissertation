The proposal for the work conducted within this dissertation was assessed 
through the School of Mathematics and Statistics ethical review procedure in 
accordance with the University of Sheffield's Research Ethics Policy. 
Ethical approval was granted in February 2020 before any relevant data related to this 
dissertation was accessed. Research ethical review was required as some of 
the data processed in this dissertation likely constitutes *personal data* as 
defined in the UK data protection legislation. The research ethics application 
was allocated reference number: 044945. Formal approval is evidenced here by 
inclusion of the final approval letter in Figure \@ref(fig:ethicsapprov).
